# FFT Transform Length

The function `fftTransformLength` computes a transform length that is
optimized for faster FFT computation in MATLAB. The function is useful for choosing the padded transform length in situations involving zero-padded FFTs.

## Installation

Download the `fft-transform-length.mltbx` file from the [GitHub repository releases area](https://github.com/eddins/fft-transform-length/releases/) or from the [File Exchange](). Double-click on the downloaded file to automatically run the MATLAB add-on installer. This will copy the files to your MATLAB add-ons area and add the `fftTransformLength` function to your MATLAB search path.

Later, you can use the [MATLAB Add-On Manager](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/get-add-ons.html) to uninstall.

## Getting Started

See the [Getting Started](./toolbox/gettingStarted.mlx) script for more information.
